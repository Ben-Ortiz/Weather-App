# Weather-App
A weather app using the Django Framework that uses the OpenWeather API to get weather to any US city.   
Inspired from this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-n5QAuQSr8&t=1490s)

# What I Learned  
* Django: Running multiple servers is possible and can be confusing when trying to run your app. Make sure all unrelated servers shutdown before running main server
* Python: learned how a basic Django webapp is made
* gitignore: running the commands:   
  ```
  git rm -rf --cached .    
  git add .
  ```    
  after adding the .gitignore and what files to ignore makes the gitignore apply the changes
